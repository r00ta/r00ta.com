Hey everyone!

This blog will be my central hub for everything I’m working on across the web. I’ll be sharing posts on topics that (hopefully!) interest you, along with links to other projects I’m building.

One of those projects is a dedicated site about MAAS, which you can check out here: [https://docs.r00ta.com](https://docs.r00ta.com). Stay tuned for more updates!
