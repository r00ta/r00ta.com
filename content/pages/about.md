Currently a Software Engineer @ Canonical. Cycling and running lover.

I’m r00ta, also known as Jacopo Rota in the real world. I don’t know how you landed here, but hey, welcome!

When I was at the University I had two main passions: cyber security and machine learning - in particular the so called statistical learning. I used to play CTF (Capture the Flag) contests with [Fuffateam](https://l4ser.github.io/), you can find some write ups in this [repo](https://github.com/r00ta/myWriteUps).

In the past I founded a startup, I worked for [Swiss RE](https://www.swissre.com/) to build a while label product for the telematics insurance market worldwide and for [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/it) for its cloud offering.

Then, I joined [Canonical](https://canonical.com/) to work on [MAAS](https://maas.io/) because I love low level stuff and hardware hell yeah.

When I’m not sitting at my desk or enjoying life with my family, I’m probably cycling, running or hiking.
